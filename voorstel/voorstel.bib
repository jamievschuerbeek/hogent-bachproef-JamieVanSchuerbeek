  abstract  = {Information Extraction (IE) techniques aim to extract the names
of entities and objects from text and to identify the roles that they play in
event descriptions. IE systems generally focus on a specific domain or topic,
searching only for information that is relevant to a userâ€™s interests. In this
chapter, we first give historical background on information extraction and discuss several kinds of information extraction tasks that have emerged in recent
years. Next, we outline the series of steps that are involved in creating a typical information extraction system, which can be encoded as a cascaded finitestate transducer. Along the way, we present examples to illustrate what each
step does. Finally, we present an overview of different learning-based methods
for information extraction, including supervised learning approaches, weakly
supervised and bootstrapping techniques, and discourse-oriented approaches.},

  abstract      = {We consider the problem of learning to perform information extraction in domains where linguistic processing is problematic, such as Usenet posts, email, and finger plan files. In place of syntactic and semantic information, other sources of information can be used, such as term frequency, typography, formatting, and mark-up. We describe four learning approaches to this problem, each drawn from a different paradigm: a rote learner, a term-space learner based on Naive Bayes, an approach using grammatical induction, and a relational rule learner. Experiments on 14 information extraction problems defined over four diverse document collections demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches. Finally, we describe a multistrategy approach which combines these learners and yields performance competitive with or better than the best of them. This technique is modular and flexible, and could find application in other machine learning problems.},

  abstract     = {Information extraction (IE) is an important and growing field, in part because of the development of ubiquitous social media networking millions of people and producing huge collections of textual information. Mined information is being used in a wide array of application areas from targeted marketing of products to intelligence gathering for military and security needs. IE has its roots in artificial intelligence fields including machine learning, logic and search algorithms, computational linguistics, and pattern recognition. This review summarizes the history of IE, surveys the various uses of IE, identifies current technological accomplishments and challenges, and explores the role that neural and adaptive computing might play in future research. A goal for this review is also to encourage practitioners of neural and adaptive computing to look for interesting applications in the important emerging area of IE.},
